# mcgrawtower
Big Ben Clock clone for Cornell McGraw Tower

This is the source code for @mcgrawtower. It is a simple Python script that tweets "CHIME" times the current hour. It used to be running on my RaspberryPI at home as a cron task schedueled to fire every hour. Now it is currently running on a DigitalOcean droplet.

edit: this code is crap btw, im gonna rewrite this someday.
